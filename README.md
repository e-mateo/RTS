# Real Time Strategy

## Introduction
 `Real Time Strategy` is a game project made on Unity 3D, focused on implementing AI systems to create an RTS Game. <br>
 This project has been made by **RABINNE Lenny** and **ERBISTI Mat√©o**, programming students at Isart Digital Paris. <br>
 Started on `March 18th, 2024` and finished on `April 16th, 2024`. <br>
 In this project, a template was given to us and we only added code relative to Artificial Intelligence.

## Description

### Strategic FSM:
Firstly, we implemented a Finite State Machine system to choose the strategic state of our AI. The AI opponent can have one of these three states: Aggressive, Defensive, and Expansion. <br>
The Finite State Machine will switch from one state to another depending on different parameters of the world state.

### Squad Utility System:
Each squad of the AI will choose a goal thanks to its Utility System. We created a Utility System with Goals. <br> A goal can be to attack an enemy base, defend a base, take over a laboratory, or even attack an enemy squad. <br>
The Utility System will take into account the Strategic State that will influence the priority of each goal as well as parameters from the world state. <br>

### Unit Decision Tree:
Once a squad has chosen its goal, every unit of the squad will select the right decision tree to make this goal. <br>
We chose to implement a decision tree for our micromanagement because it's only simple tasks that don't need more than 2 or 3 actions and a decision tree is easy to implement. <br>

### Resource Management Utility System:
For resource management, we chose to reuse the Utility System that we made but with different goals such as CreateSquad, CreateFactory, Economy... <br>
Resource management will also be influenced by the strategic state and the world state to choose the right goal. <br>

### Formation:
We implemented a two-level steering system formation with an invisible leader to move the squads. The speed of the formation will adapt depending on the unit with the lowest speed. <br>
We implemented 3 formation types: Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle. <br>

### Unit Movement:
Units can also move on their own during specific tasks such as attacking an enemy base. <br> We used Unity Nav Mesh and Nav Mesh Agent to make their movement.

### Influence Map:
We created an influence map system accessible from the world state that can tell us the influence at a chosen position to see which team has control and how much. <br>
